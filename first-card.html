            <p>
            I always had an interest in math and problem solving
            which was why my Major heading into college was Physics
            but I felt something was lacking as I pursued my degree.
            </p>
            <p>
            I realized as I took my first programming course that 
            programming had something concrete and you were able
            to see the results of your efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
            I have enjoyed programming ever since.
